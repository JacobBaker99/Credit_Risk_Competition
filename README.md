# Credit_Risk_Kaggle_Competition

This repository contains the code developed by Team Front Line for the Kaggle competition, "Home Credit - Credit Risk Model Stability."
## Goal:
Develop a model to predict loan defaults for clients with little credit history.
Emphasize model stability, ensuring consistent performance over time.
## Project Structure:
The specific folder structure will depend on your workflow, but standard directories might include:
Data: Stores competition datasets.
Notebooks: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and model development.
Models: Saves trained models and their configurations.
Reports: Includes figures, tables, and other visualizations used in the analysis.
## Evaluation Metric:
The competition uses a custom Gini stability metric considering predictive power and stability over time.
